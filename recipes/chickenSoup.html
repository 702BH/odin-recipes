    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4-5 medium-sized potatoes, peeled and cut into cubes</li>
        <li>2 medium-sized carrots, peeled and cut into thick slices (about 1/2-inch or 1 cm thick)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and black pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine minced garlic, diced onion, chicken broth, soy sauce, honey, olive oil, dried thyme, dried rosemary, black pepper, and salt. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Place the seasoned chicken breasts in the slow cooker and pour the garlic sauce mixture over the top.</li>
        <li>Add the potato cubes and carrot slices to the slow cooker, arranging them around the chicken.</li>
        <li>If needed, add additional water until the liquid covers the chicken and reaches about halfway up the vegetables. The exact amount of water will depend on the size of your slow cooker and the quantity of ingredients. Be cautious not to add too much water to avoid diluting the flavors.</li>
        <li>Cover the slow cooker and cook on low heat for 4-6 hours or until the chicken is tender and the potatoes and carrots are cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
